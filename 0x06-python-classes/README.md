# 0x06. Python - Classes and Objects

In Python, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. Objects are instances of a class, which means they can access the class's attributes and methods.
For example, consider a class Dog. This class might have attributes like name and age, and methods like bark and fetch.
You can create an object of this class like so: my_dog = Dog(). Now my_dog is an object of the Dog class, and can access its attributes and methods. For example, my_dog.bark() would call the bark method of the Dog class.
