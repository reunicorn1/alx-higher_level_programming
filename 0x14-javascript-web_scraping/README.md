# 0x14. JavaScript - Web scraping

## Introduction 
When it comes to web scraping, JSON data is often used by APIs to transmit data between the server and the client. When you make a request to a server that returns JSON data, you can use JavaScript's built-in JSON.parse() method to convert this JSON data into a JavaScript object. This object can then be manipulated and used within your JavaScript code.

## Learning Objectives
In this project, learners got to experiment with how to manipulate JSON data and recieve it using a web scraping operation, as well as making HTML requests in javascript using Request module to fetch the API.
Data can be easily streamed into files using the fs module as well.
