# 0x08. Python - More Classes and Objects

In Python, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. Objects are instances of a class, which means they can access the class's attributes and methods.
A class is defined using the class keyword, followed by the class name and a colon. Inside the class, you can define attributes (variables) and methods (functions).
For example, consider a class Dog. This class might have attributes like name and age, and methods like bark and eat.
An object is an instance of a class. You create an object of a class by calling the class name as if it were a function. For example, fido = Dog() creates a new Dog object.
Each object can have different attribute values. So, if you create another Dog object, say rex = Dog(), rex and fido are two different objects, even though they are both instances of the Dog class.
Remember, the class is the blueprint, and the objects are individual instances of that blueprint that can have their own specific attribute values.
