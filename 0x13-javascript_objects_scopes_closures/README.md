# 0x13. JavaScript - Objects, Scopes and Closures

JavaScript objects are a core concept in JavaScript. They are containers for named values, called properties and methods. An object can be created with figure brackets {...} with an optional list of properties. Each property is a "key: value" pair, where key is a string (or a symbol) and value can be anything.
Scope in JavaScript refers to the current context of the code, which determines the accessibility of variables. There are two types of scope: global scope (variables defined outside of all functions) and local scope (variables defined inside a function).
Closures in JavaScript are functions that have access to the parent scope, even after the parent function has closed. This is a powerful feature in JavaScript, as it allows you to control what is and isn't in the global namespace, making it an effective way to limit variable scope and avoid potential naming collisions.
