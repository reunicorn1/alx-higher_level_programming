# 0x09. Python - Everything is object

In Python, everything is an object. This means that all data types, including functions and classes, are instances of a class. Each object has a unique identity, a type, and a value. The identity never changes once an object is created, the type determines what operations the object supports, and the value can change for mutable objects but not for immutable ones. This object-oriented nature of Python allows for a lot of flexibility and powerful programming patterns.
