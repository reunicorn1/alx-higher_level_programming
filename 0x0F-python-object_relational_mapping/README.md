# 0x0F. Python - Object-relational mapping

MySQLdb is a Python interface to MySQL. It's a thin wrapper over the MySQL C API, and it's very specific to MySQL. It allows you to execute raw SQL queries and fetch results.

SQLAlchmey is a module with two major components which are the SQLAlchemy Core and the SQLAlchemy ORM.
The Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) libraries like SQLAlchemy allow you to interact with your database, like you would with SQL, but using Pythonic code.
