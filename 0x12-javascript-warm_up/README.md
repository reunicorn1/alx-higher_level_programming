# 0x12. JavaScript - Warm up

JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is primarily used for enhancing web pages to provide for a more user interactive experience. It allows you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else on the webpage.
While HTML and CSS give structure and style to web pages, JavaScript provides web pages interactive elements that engage a user. It's an essential part of web applications and is supported by all modern web browsers without plug-ins.
It's worth noting that JavaScript is not related to Java, despite the similarity in their names. They are two distinct languages.
