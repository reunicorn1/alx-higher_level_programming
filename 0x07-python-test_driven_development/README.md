# 0x07. Python - Test-driven development

Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle. In Python, as in other languages, the steps are as follows:
Write a test for the smallest possible increment of functionality.
Run the test, which should fail because the functionality isn't implemented yet.
Write just enough code to make the test pass.
Refactor the code, making it as simple and clear as possible without breaking the functionality (the test should still pass).
This cycle is repeated for each new functionality until the software is complete. The idea is that by writing tests first, you ensure that your code is always testable and that every piece of functionality is tested.
